This is a music player web app although its not finished and i've not added some functionalities

Its basically just the UI at this point.
Im working on another better music app where I'll integrate spotify api to get live music data.

On this app, i made use of Tailwind CSS, Styled Components and CSS for the styling
I used react practices like react router, state managements, react hooks.
I also made use of some icon libraries for the icons i used.
